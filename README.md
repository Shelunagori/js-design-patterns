# JavaScript Design Patterns


This repository contains implementations and explanations of various design patterns in JavaScript.

## Factory Pattern
- **Description**: The Factory Pattern provides an interface for creating objects without specifying their concrete classes. It defines a method for creating objects, which subclasses can then override to specify the derived type that will be instantiated.
- **Example**: [factory.js](factory_pattern.js)
- **Usage**: This pattern is useful when you need to create multiple instances of objects without exposing the instantiation logic.

## Iterator Pattern
- **Description**: The Iterator Pattern provides a way to access elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation. It decouples the algorithm for accessing elements from the aggregate object's structure.
- **Example**: [iterator.js](iterator_pattern.js)
- **Usage**: Use this pattern when you want to traverse through a collection of elements without exposing the internal structure of the collection.

## Observer Pattern
- **Description**: The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
- **Example**: [observer.js](observer_pattern.js)
- **Usage**: This pattern is useful when you want to maintain consistency between related objects without coupling them tightly.

## Proxy Pattern
- **Description**: The Proxy Pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. It allows you to add behavior to the accessed object without changing its code.
- **Example**: [proxy.js](proxy_patern.js)
- **Usage**: Use this pattern when you want to control access to an object or add additional functionalities such as caching, logging, etc.

## Singleton Pattern
- **Description**: The Singleton Pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.
- **Example**: [singleton.js](singleton_pattern.js)
- **Usage**: Use this pattern when you need to restrict instantiation of a class to a single object, such as database connections, logging systems, etc.

## Strategy Pattern
- **Description**: The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. It allows the algorithm to vary independently from clients that use it.
- **Example**: [strategy.js](stragety_partten.js)
- **Usage**: Use this pattern when you want to define a set of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable at runtime.

## Visitor Pattern
- **Description**: The Visitor Pattern represents an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure. It lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.
- **Example**: [visitor.js](visitor_pattern.js)
- **Usage**: Use this pattern when you need to perform operations on the elements of an object structure without changing their classes.
